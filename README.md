# LG-Webos-Hackathon

#Problem Statement:
The owner of the company has no live tracking of the logistics vehicle which are on their way for delivery. 
Few of the medium size companies do not have any tools to keep digital records of the Goods transportation or to analyse them. 
Around 20% of road accidents occur due to driverâ€™s drowsiness and more than 23% of truck drivers have sleep deprivation.
In a long route, there are more chances of truck drivers feeling sleepy which can cause serious accidents.

#Goal:
We aim to develop a tool/app which can allow the company owner to track the live GPS status of the logistic vehicle which are on their way to deliver the goods from one place to another. 
The app should also include a section for detecting the drowsiness of the driver and reports the status back to the company owner or whosoever is in charge of the app.
Moreover, the app can store the journey data as well as provide an analysis for better business performance.
